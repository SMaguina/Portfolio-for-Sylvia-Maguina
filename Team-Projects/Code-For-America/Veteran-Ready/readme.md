### Veteran Ready Website

***

#### Objective

This is a website redesign of a website called Veteran Ready, which is a source for helping Nevada veterans find jobs upon moving to Las Vegas or returning back to civilian life. The site that was to be improved upon was originally created via Wix and the website owner came to the local Code for America group (Code for Vegas) in order to help her redesign and expand upon the site. The client envisioned a site that expanded upon creating a community-based website with the ability to share links and create more interaction and contributions from fellow veterans. So, the overall objective was to make the government site clean, informational, and community-oriented.

#### My Contributions

I came into the project when the MVP was about 75% done already and had the opportunity to meet with the client to ask her more UX design oriented questions. I also went with the group to the local council to receive approval for the project by the local government. For the website, I imported a sans-serif typography to provide a more crisp and modern feel while offering easiness to read through the data displaying on the web. The copy is kept succint and simple, guiding the user towards the proper information they're looking for. The overall style guide is to keep it a flat design with emphasis on a matte undertone color palette. Again, the focus is on a clean, concise and to-the-point design to keep the site user-centric. The solid matte colors keep attention away from flashy, bright colors and have the user focus more on the functionality of the site. The iconography will maintain a minimalistic yet universal purpose, and will be used around the site for users to easily understand their presence and actions. I also helped optimize the web images for fast web page speed and performance.

#### Results

The contributions of the Code for Vegas team allowed us to complete a Minimum Viable Product that can be viewed on Heroku [here](http://veteran-ready.herokuapp.com).
